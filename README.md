# Auto-sklearn Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of **Auto-sklearn**, an automated machine learning (AutoML) library. Auto-sklearn is a powerful tool for building machine learning models without the need for extensive manual tuning. This project provides a step-by-step guide to utilizing its capabilities for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.

## Features

- Automated model selection and training
- Hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization
- Example dataset analysis and performance evaluation
- Code and workflow fully contained within a Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages:
  - `auto-sklearn`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations)

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install auto-sklearn numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/auto-sklearn-project.git
   cd auto-sklearn-project
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Auto_Sklearn.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore Auto-sklearn's capabilities.
